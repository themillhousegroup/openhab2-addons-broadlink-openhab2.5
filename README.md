## openHAB 2 Add-ons

This repository contains the work on the Broadlink Binding for OpenHAB 2.5, 
as discussed on the [OpenHAB forum](https://community.openhab.org/t/broadlink-binding-for-rmx-a1-spx-and-mp-any-interest/22768)

This repo has been archived as future development will be based on the OpenHAB 3.0 platform - which will be forked again and available [here](https://github.com/themillhousegroup/openhab2-addons)
